Uses HTML to create an interactive Tip Calculator with three user interactive inputs: bill size, number of people, and desired tip. Users must then click submit button which runs a JS that calculates the desired tip amount and provides the output. If the inputs are not sufficient an alert is loaded and the html form is reloaded.
